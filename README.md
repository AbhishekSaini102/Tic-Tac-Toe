# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game project! This project is built using React.js and includes various features such as different board sizes (3x3 and N*N), an AI opponent, player suggestions, and a timer.

## Features

- **Multiple Board Sizes**: Play on a classic 3x3 grid or choose larger grids like 4x4, 5x5, or more.
- **AI Opponent**: Challenge an AI opponent with different levels of difficulty.
- **Player Suggestions**: Get hints for the best moves.
- **Timer**: Track the duration of your game.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adjusts nicely for different screen sizes.

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

- **Components**: Divide the UI into small, reusable components. Each component should have its own file.

- **Utilities**: Place utility functions (e.g., `calculateWinner.js`) in a separate `utils` folder.

### State Management

- Use `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state and side effects.

### Styling

- Use CSS modules or a dedicated stylesheet (`TicTacToe.css`) for styling components.

### Performance Optimization

- Use React.memo or useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
